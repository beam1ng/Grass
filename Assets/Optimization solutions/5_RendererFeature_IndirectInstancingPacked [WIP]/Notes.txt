Adding code responsible for rotating grass blades by hash function from IN.instanceId improved cpu side load 
from 6.0ms to 5.0ms. It seems contrary to what's expected, but by rotating the blades, less fragment shaders
were invoked, greatly reducing the overdraw. I don't know though, why did it improve the CPU performance - does 
it need to process something? Or is it just waiting for something... Unchanged 2.0ms GPU time doesn't help here...
